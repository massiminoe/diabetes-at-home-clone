## Spec Overview ##

Your team has been contracted to design and 
build software for Diabetes@Home, a startup 
who plan to sell digital health solutions.

You will build their flagship product, a web app 
that helps people to manage their diabetes in the 
convenience of their own home, recording data 
that can be monitored remotely by their clinician.

You need to make two different user-interfaces for the app: one for patients and one for clinicians. These will share a database. 

The app will service about 5,000 patients and 100 clinicians who are located in Victoria, 
Australia. Each patient is managed by one clinician, while a given clinician may manage 
many patients.*
